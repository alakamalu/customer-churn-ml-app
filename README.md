## 📊 Customer Churn Prediction — End-to-End ML Project

This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn.

The system takes customer details as input, processes them using trained ML preprocessing steps, and provides:

* Churn prediction (YES / NO)
* Churn probability (%)
* Risk level (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

The model is deployed as an interactive web application.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Real-world business problem (customer retention)
- Full ML pipeline from data to deployment
- Feature selection using Random Forest importance
- Logistic Regression classification model
- Data preprocessing with encoding and scaling
- Interactive web interface using Flask
- Dropdown handling for categorical features
- Probability-based risk classification
- Cloud deployment ready


## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Handling missing values
3. Label encoding categorical variables
4. Feature selection using feature importance
5. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
6. Train-test split
7. Model training and evaluation
8. Model selection based on recall and ROC-AUC
9. Saving model and preprocessing objects
10. Web deployment using Flask


## 🤖 Model Used

Logistic Regression was selected because:

* Higher recall for churn class
* Better ROC-AUC score
* Interpretable predictions
* Stable performance


## 📥 Input Features

The web application accepts the following customer attributes:

* Total Charges
* Monthly Charges
* Tenure
* Contract Type
* Payment Method
* Online Security
* Tech Support

Categorical features are selected using dropdown menus and automatically encoded.


## 📈 Output Provided

The system predicts:

* Whether customer will churn (YES / NO)
* Probability of churn
* Risk level classification

Example output:

```
Prediction: YES — Customer is likely to churn
Churn Probability: 82%
Risk Level: HIGH
```

## 🖥️ Web Application

The trained model is integrated into a Flask web app that:

* Accepts user inputs
* Applies encoding and scaling
* Generates predictions instantly
* Displays results in a professional UI
